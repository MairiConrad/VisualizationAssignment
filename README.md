# VisualizationAssignment

## _**Overview**_
In this repo, I will show a visualization that I created using Matplotlib. I will show my process for creating a visualization using the MATLAB-Style of visualization and creating the same visualization in an object oriented visualization. I made the visual as personalized as possible. I had a lot of difficulty understanding how to use matplotlib during the visualization section of the course and I wanted to prove to myself that I could figure out how to create a simple visualization in both MATLAB-Style and in an object-oriented style from scratch.

## _**Data**_
The data I used was a built-in dataset within Seaborn that assesses the miles per gallon of fuel usage within vehicles made during the years 1970-1982. I decided to assess mileage of vehicles based on the year of the car and then to look at the changes in the weight of cars over the same time period.

## _**Technology Used**_

- [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)

## _**Still Image Walk Through**_
I decided to do a still image walk through of my visualization process because I find reading and images easier to understand a topic than videos and thought that maybe someone else may feel the same way. I also have a cold and don't want to be coughing in a video.

**Step One**: Importing + finding a dataset with Seaborn
