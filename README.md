# VisualizationAssignment

## _**Overview**_
In this repo, I will show a visualization that I created using Matplotlib. I will show my process for creating a visualization using the MATLAB-Style of visualization. I made the visual as personalized as possible.

## _**Data**_
The data I used was a built in dataset within Seaborn that assess the miles per gallon of fuel usage within vehicles. I decided to assess mileage of vehicles based on the origin of the car in order to determine which area of origin would have the best mileage per gallon of fuel.

- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)

## _**Still Image Walk Through**_
I decided to do a still image walk through of my visualization process because I find reading and images easier to understand a topic than videos and thought that maybe someone else may feel the same way.
